## ðŸ§¾ Project Summary & Learning Outcomes

This project was a comprehensive exploration of apartment pricing trends in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Starting with raw CSV files, I performed data wrangling, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling to uncover insights and build a functional pricing tool.

Through this process, I:

- Filtered and cleaned real-world housing data using `pandas`
- Visualized pricing patterns with `matplotlib` and `plotly`
- Built and evaluated a regression model using `scikit-learn`
- Created a custom prediction function for real-time price estimation
- Developed an interactive MVP using `ipywidgets` for user-driven predictions

ðŸ“Œ **Key Takeaways**:
- Learned how to handle messy, multi-source datasets
- Improved my ability to communicate insights through visual storytelling
- Gained hands-on experience with regression modeling and evaluation metrics
- Practiced building user-friendly interfaces inside Jupyter Notebooks
- Strengthened my end-to-end project workflowâ€”from raw data to interactive tool

This project showcases my ability to combine data science, machine learning, and user experience design into a cohesive, practical solution.
